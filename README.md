# Fresh JS Project

This is a simple repository to test out the recently released web framework `Fresh`. This framework is similar in functionality to frameworks such as [Astro](https://astro.build/) but runs on the Deno runtime.

# Deployment

For this project I decided to use Deno's OOTB deployment strategy [Deno Deploy](https://deno.com/deploy)
